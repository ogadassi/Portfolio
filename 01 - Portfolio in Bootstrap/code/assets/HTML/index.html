    <h2>What is programming?</h2>
    <p> A programming language is a formalized system of instructions that can be used to instruct a computer or a
        machine
        to perform specific tasks or operations. It serves as an intermediary between human programmers and the computer
        hardware, allowing programmers to write code that can be executed by the computer.</p>

    <p>Programming languages are designed to be readable and writable by humans, and they provide a set of rules and
        syntax
        for specifying the logic and behavior of a computer program. Each programming language has its own set of
        keywords,
        operators, data types, and control structures that define how instructions are written and how they are
        executed.</p>

    <p>There are many programming languages available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses, and they are used for
        a
        wide range of applications, from web development and mobile app development to scientific computing, artificial
        intelligence, and embedded systems programming. Some well-known programming languages include Python, Java, C++,
        JavaScript, Ruby, and many others. Choosing the right programming language for a particular task often depends
        on
        the requirements of the project and the preferences of the programmer or development team.</p>
