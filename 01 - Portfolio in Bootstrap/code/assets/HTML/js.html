    <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>JavaScript is a versatile and widely-used programming language primarily known for its role in web development.
        It enables developers to add interactivity, manipulate web page content, and create dynamic web applications.
        JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers, making it a fundamental technology for client-side scripting
        in web development.
    </p>
    <p>Here are some key aspects of JavaScript:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Client-Side Scripting: JavaScript is primarily executed on the client-side, meaning it runs in a user's web
            browser. It allows developers to create interactive user interfaces, respond to user actions, and perform
            client-side validation without the need for server communication.</li><br>
        <li>Dynamic Web Content: JavaScript can dynamically modify and update web page content. This includes adding or
            removing elements, changing text and images, and responding to user inputs (e.g., form submissions, button
            clicks).</li><br>
        <li>Event Handling: JavaScript is widely used for event handling. Developers can attach JavaScript functions to
            various events like mouse clicks, keyboard inputs, and form submissions to trigger specific actions in
            response.</li><br>
        <li>Cascading: The term "cascading" in CSS refers to the order in which styles are applied. Styles can come from
            various sources, such as external CSS files, internal style
            elements, or inline styles. If conflicting styles are applied to the same element,
            the CSS cascade rules determine which style takes precedence.</li><br>
        <li>DOM Manipulation: JavaScript interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM), a representation of the web
            page's structure. Developers can use JavaScript to traverse and manipulate the DOM, allowing them to create
            dynamic and responsive web pages.</li><br>
        <li>AJAX: JavaScript facilitates asynchronous communication with web servers using technologies like
            XMLHttpRequest or the more modern Fetch API. This enables fetching data from a server and updating parts of
            a web page without requiring a full page reload.</li><br>
        <li>Frameworks and Libraries: There are many JavaScript libraries and frameworks available, such as React,
            Angular, and Vue.js, which simplify and enhance the development of complex web applications. These tools
            provide reusable components and architectural patterns.</li><br>
        <li>Server-Side JavaScript: While JavaScript is predominantly a client-side language, it can also be used for
            server-side scripting. Node.js is a popular runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript on
            the server, enabling full-stack JavaScript development.</li><br>
        <li>Cross-Browser Compatibility: JavaScript has been standardized by the ECMAScript specification, which ensures
            consistency across different web browsers. However, developers often use transpilers like Babel to write
            code that works across a broader range of browsers.</li><br>
