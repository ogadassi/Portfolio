    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <p>CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation and
        layout of web documents written in HTML or XML. In simpler terms, CSS is used to control how web content is
        displayed on a web page, including the design, formatting, colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning of elements.
    </p>
    <p>Here are some key points about CSS:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Separation of Content and Presentation: One of the fundamental principles of web development is the
            separation of content (HTML) and presentation (CSS). HTML defines the structure and content of a web page,
            while CSS specifies how that content should be styled and displayed. This separation makes it easier to
            maintain and update websites.</li><br>
        <li>Selectors and Rules: CSS uses selectors to target specific HTML elements and apply styling rules to them.
            For example, you can use a CSS rule to change the color of all headings (e.g., h1, h2, etc.) or to set
            the background color of a specific div element.</li><br>
        <li>Properties and Values: CSS properties determine what aspect of an element's style is being defined (e.g.,
            color, font-size, margin), and values specify the specific characteristics (e.g., red, 16px, 20px).
            Properties and values are combined to create CSS rules.</li><br>
        <li>Cascading: The term "cascading" in CSS refers to the order in which styles are applied. Styles can come from
            various sources, such as external CSS files, internal style
            elements, or inline styles. If conflicting styles are applied to the same element,
            the CSS cascade rules determine which style takes precedence.</li><br>
        <li>Responsive Design: CSS is crucial for creating responsive web designs that adapt to different screen sizes
            and devices. Media queries, a feature of CSS, allow developers to apply different styles based on factors
            like screen width, making websites more mobile-friendly.</li><br>
        <li>Frameworks and Preprocessors: Many developers use CSS frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap, Foundation) to streamline
            the process of designing and styling web pages. Additionally, CSS preprocessors like Sass and Less offer
            enhanced features and efficiency for writing CSS code.</li><br>
